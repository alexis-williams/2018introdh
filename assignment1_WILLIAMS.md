## Assignment 1
My [data](https://alexis-williams.github.io/dh-topic-models/) set consisted of about 8,000 academic journals related to the psychology of gender and development, all published between 2008 and 2018.
I felt 8,000 academic journals would be a comfortable number to use in order to generate enough data to create an interesting topic model, but not overload my computer or RStudio with extreme amounts of data. I also limited how old my data could be because typically, psychology and scientific articles tend to go out of date after about 5 years, but I wanted to make sure I had enough data to create a trend, so I doubled the time limit.

Based on the topic model, the academic journals look at how gender effects child development. The journals look at home life, school life and social life.For example, "social actions", "social development" and "behaviors". Race and ethnicity are prominent topics, as are many different disorders, like PTSD and neuroticism. Sexuality is also a prominent topic in my topic model. This is interesting because I think those could be the different levels of the Independent Variable when designing a study. Using children of all racial backgrounds and ethnicities, all sexualities, and using kids with and without personality disorders allows for the most comprehensive and most significant results.

Using this topic model, I think questions about what to look for when studying gender and development in kids is answered. I think a psychologist looking for another study to perform could benefit from this topic model. It gives enough information about *what* to study, without giving *all* of the information on how the study was conducted, which would allow the psychologist a lot of freedom when designing the experiment.
## Overall Experience
Overall, this was an interesting and new experience. I learned very much, but I also thought it was a difficult process. If I could change anything, it would be using RStudio on my laptop. It was not working for me, but thankfully I was able to use a University Mac and finished my topic model. One other thing I would change about the topic model itself is the random numbers and random non-English phrases that are topics of their own. Being able to use stop words and make those disappear would be nice.

Despite those two negatives, I think this was a straightforward assignment, and now I feel more confident about topic models. I understand that they give people a look at many, many articles, and show trends, if any. I also understand that topic models only look at documents at "face value", meaning the words are just letters, not words with meaning. This is a slight difficulty when using topic modeling, because of words like "duck", the animal, and "duck", the bodily movement. The computer does not use context, so it assumes the two are the same. This is a common difficulty, and it would be nice to alleviate it, because then even more context could be given to topic models, and trends could possibly be easier seen.
